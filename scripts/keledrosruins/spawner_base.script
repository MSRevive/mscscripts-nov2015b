//Thothie - I percieve anything else in the Keledros script that would cause brain death
//- It seems very likely that the createNPC meathod does not clean out memory the same way a standard msmonster_spawn does
//- As such, I'm removing 3 spawners, and replacing with "greater animated warriors" and seeing if it helps various issues
//- Also adding new scrolls to Keledros when I get them (and him) working right
//- Also note on this: original was EXIST < 5 - meaning he could spawn more than 6 armors, so the last one survived long enough for him to summon again. (sure I've seen this happen since January)

//- Keledros now decides for himself if he can spawn more guards or not - this is kept for compatibility
